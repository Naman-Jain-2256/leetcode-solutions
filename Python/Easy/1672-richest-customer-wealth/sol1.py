Solution 1 for Leetcode 1672 - Richest Customer Wealth

Approach:
- Use a generator expression with max() to compute the wealth of each customer efficiently.

Time Complexity: O(m Ã— n) - where 'm' is the number of customers and 'n' is the number of banks
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant extra space since we're using a generator
