Solution 1 for Leetcode 14 - Longest Common Prefix

Approach:
- If the input list is empty, return an empty string.
- Use the first string in the list as the reference word.
- Iterate over each character (with index) in the first word.
- For every other word in the list, check:
    - If the current index exceeds the length of the word (which means the word is shorter), or
    - If the character at this index in the word is different from the current character in the reference.
    - If any mismatch is found, return the prefix built so far.
- If all characters at the current index match, append the character to the prefix.
- After all iterations, return the full prefix.

Time Complexity: O(N Ã— M)  
- N = number of strings  
- M = length of the shortest string (in worst case we compare that many characters for each string)

Space Complexity: O(1)  
- Only uses a few variables for tracking and does not require extra space (excluding output string).
